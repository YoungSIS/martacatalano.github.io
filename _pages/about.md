<p style = "margin-bottom:20px;"><font  size="7" >  Marta Catalano <br> </font> </p>
  
  
I am a final year PhD student in Statistics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Faculty+and+Research/Departments/Decision+Sciences/), under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/) and Prof. [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=). I am also member of the [Bayes Lab](https://www.bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Cdr/Bayeslab/Home) at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics ([BIDSA](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home)) and member of the ["de Castro" Statistics Initiative](https://www.carloalberto.org/research/statistics-initiative/) at Collegio Carlo Alberto. I recently joined the [Complex Data Modeling Research Network](https://midas.mat.uc.cl/network/) led by MiDas.<br>
Previously, I completed my bachelor and master's degree in Mathematics at University of Rome [La Sapienza](https://www.mat.uniroma1.it/didattica/corsi-di-laurea/matematica-magistrale).  A full version of my CV may be found [here](https://martacatalano.github.io/files/MartaCatalano_CV_Sep2020.pdf).
<!--I am interested in using the theory of stochastic and point processes to deal with Bayesian nonparametric models and their applications. In particular, my research is mainly focused on the uses and properties of completely random measures and their transformations.-->
