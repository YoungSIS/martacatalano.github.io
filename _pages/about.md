I am a PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University, within the [department of Decision Sciences](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Faculty+and+Research/Departments/Decision+Sciences/), under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/).  
I am interested in using the theory of stochastic and point processes to deal with Bayesian nonparametric models and their applications. In particular, my research is mainly focused on the uses and properties of completely random measures and their transformations. 

**Research**  
My current research focuses on different uses of the Wasserstein distance in Bayesian nonparametrics. My ongoing works in collaboration with Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/) and Prof. [Igor Pr$\text{\"u}$nster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=) deal with the measurement of
1. Dependence of vectors of completely random measures;
2. Sensitivity with respect to the choice of hyperparameters in survival models.

**Research interests**  
Bayesian nonparametrics, completely random measures, stochastic and point processes, exchangeability and partial exchangeability, survival analysis.
