I am a PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University, within the [department of Decision Sciences](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Faculty+and+Research/Departments/Decision+Sciences/), under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/).  
I am interested in using the theory of stochastic and point processes to deal with Bayesian nonparametric models and their applications. In particular, my research is mainly focused on the uses and properties of completely random measures and their transformations. 

**Research interests**  
Bayesian nonparametrics, completely random measures, stochastic and point processes, exchangeability and partial exchangeability, survival analysis.
